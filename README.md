# disableit
A simple loop to disable some executable

# Why tho?
The problem being solved is kubelet runs `du` on every container on a hard-coded interval to get disk usage statistics for cadvisor. For large images, that du process takes long enough and uses enough iops that it uses up the whole EBS volumeâ€™s burst capacity and then when that is gone, keeps running and just destroys nodes. we just run that to make `du` non-executable so kubelet just fails to get those metrics and the iops are preserved
